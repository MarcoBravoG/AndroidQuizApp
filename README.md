# AndroidQuizApp
### What is the project about?

Android Quiz App is an quiz game for android.  Dynamically as many categories and questions can be added, updated and deleted as desired. It currently uses Sqlite as the database. 

When the game starts, the category selection screen appears. A new game is started with the questions in the category selected here. In each game questions are randomly brought.

When the game is over, a screen appears telling you how many questions you have made correctly and incorrectly and your score.
